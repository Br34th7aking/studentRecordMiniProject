Following are the assumptions made while creating this project
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Input is supplied from a file called 'input.txt' which is in the same directory as the 'main.py' script. Please
   replace the contents of the 'input.txt' file with your instructions.

2. The output is 'appended' to a file 'output.txt'. Initially, it is an empty file (provided in the zip folder)

3. As the output is being sent to a file, I've assumed that it is sufficient to 'write' the result of functions
'extract-max', and 'maximum' rather than returning a value from them.

4. The output file shows the output of every instruction. But 'insert' and 'delete' do not produce an output.
For example:
a sequence of instructions: insert abhijit Raj oopd
                            show

will produce an output:

Instruction #1
***********************************************
Instruction #2
***********************************************
List of all current students
-------------------------------
First Name: abhijit
Last Name: Raj
Courses Taken: oopd

(Note: there is no output for Instruction #1)

5. As the output file is opened in 'append+' format, all the instructions will produce outputs one below the other.
